    "# My Approach on APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I started by thinking about how to practice working with APIs in Python, so I decided to use the free JSONPlaceholder API since it provides dummy data that’s perfect for testing. My goal was to fetch information about a user and display some key details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choosing the Library: I picked the ```requests``` library because it’s the most straightforward way to make HTTP requests in Python. I imported it at the top of the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defining the API Endpoint: I looked at the JSONPlaceholder documentation and found that ```https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1``` would return details about a single user with ID 1. I stored this URL in a variable called url so the code would be clear and easy to modify later if I wanted to fetch a different user.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Making the Request: I used ```requests.get(url)``` to send a GET request to the API. To capture the response, I stored it in the variable response.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parsing the Response:\n",
    "Since the response comes in JSON format, I converted it into a Python dictionary using ```.json()```. I assigned that to the variable data, so I could access individual fields easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accessing the Data:\n",
    "Once I had the data, I picked out some interesting fields: the user’s name, email, and their company name. These are nested values in the JSON, so for example, ```data[\"company\"][\"name\"] ``` retrieves the company name from inside the company object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Displaying the Results:\n",
    "Finally, I used ```print()``` statements to display the information in a readable format."
